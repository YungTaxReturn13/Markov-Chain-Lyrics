# Markov-Chain-Lyrics

This project generates random Markov-Chain Lyrics for a given artist by referencing lyrics from the Genius website in the command line

Once you enter your genius API token in the authentication.txt file you can begin to run the code

Running main.py, it will prompt you for an artist. Make sure to enter the artist name exactly as it is shown on the [Genius](https://genius.com) website. It will take the top 10 songs and store as a database to refer to. 

Then the program will generate random lyrics. Most are pretty bad but sometimes you get a gem 

## Examples 

Frank Ocean: "love love before my favorite color to hell for heaven's sakes, go"

Mitski: "too busy on losing dogs? i was making things, too much"

Phoebe Bridgers: "dad lived in circles pretending to walk right back"

Sufjan Stevens: "i happen to explore i found out now? my enemies i donâ€™t know where to begin and grieve my evil"
